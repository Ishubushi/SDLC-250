How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
User stories play a big part in understanding user needs and implementing them into a program. When a client gives details about the desired outcome and wants of their project, user stories help
enable priorities to be placed and even give the opportunity to help the client see maybe some needs are not as important as others.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I would approach developing programs by disecting the project into smaller bits that can be iteratively and incrementally developed and tested.
Test Driven Development would help achieve this goal by helping write tests to consider edge cases and possible failures to more easily account for ideal code

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A good team member means to listen first and communicate second. Too many times we would rather speak than listen and if chosen to do so could prevent us from
hearing crucial details that may be important.
